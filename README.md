# Tasks Emailer

Sends an email to yourself with your upcoming Google Tasks and Google Calendar events.

My motivation for making this was that I am good about putting things into my Calendar and Tasks, but would get distracted and forget what is coming up. My solution was to make this script that sends me an email with the tasks and events coming up in the next 7 days. 

To make it a little less of a chore to go through my tasks right when I wake up I had the script embed an image from a top post in reddit.com/r/aww, usually a cute dog or something. And then to add a little more usefulness I used the yweather Python module to tell me the upcoming days' forecast. 

Currently I have the script run on a schedule using PythonAnywhere.com because my computer doesn't run 24/7 so I'm going to give instuctions on how to get that set up below.
